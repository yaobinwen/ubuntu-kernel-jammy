Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

- [1] [Ubuntu: Build Your Own Kernel](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/BuildYourOwnKernel)

1. Install `ansible` (if not installed by the VM provisioner): `sudo ./ansible/ansible-bootstrap.sh`
2. Install the necessary development tools:
  - 2.1 `cd ansible`
  - 2.2 `ansible-playbook -K -vvv dev-env.yml`
3. Configure the kernel (if needed). Refer to [1] for the instructions.
4. Build the kernel:
  - 4.1 `cd` into the root directory of kernel source.
  - 4.2 `LANG=C fakeroot debian/rules clean`
  - 4.3 Build in one of the following ways:
    - 4.3.1 (Quicker build) `LANG=C fakeroot debian/rules binary-headers binary-generic binary-perarch`
    - 4.3.2 (Need linux-tools or lowlatency kernel) `LANG=C fakeroot debian/rules binary`
